# LeetCode

This repository contains solutions to some of the common interview problems that you could find on the leetcode. The problems are categorized as per their difficulty levels at the time the problem was solved. If in the future leetcode changes the difficulty levels of some problems, as they sometime do, the files would no longer be in the correct folder, but that shouldn't change anything about the solution itself.


Feel free to submit any issue or bug on the repo, if you see any issue.
